Until this project is complete i will keep a diary, or log, of my progress.
I was at the local park when i walked past a small library on a stick. I had seen them before while driving in a city but never stopped. At the park i walked up to this one and inspected it closer. There were various books inside, topics for children, young adult etc etc. You take one to read, you put it back. You add a book. Very community driven. But i thought to myself it would be cool if you could check the inventory before going out here.
That is where the idea for creating an app that tracks the book selection at your LFL. It does depend on the community to update however that falls in line with what the LFL is all about.
I attempted at first, like many ideas, to go big. Worldwide, dive into the API listing all 100k plus locations, but once I was denied access to the API. I thought to myself, lets start small. Get an MVP out there at least. SO i start this with my local LFL, the one I drove past.
SO on with it...
